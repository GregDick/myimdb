# myimdb
This project uses the OMDB API to make a web application to lookup movies, display the selection as a poster, with the title and year and a short description, then give the user a choice to add the movie to a table with the same information, which persists. Good times. Uses Firebase, Jquery and Lodash.

Members of this team are Edwin Acevedo, Ben Copeland, Greg Dick, Beau Rogers, Roy Schuyler and Kyle Turco. All are in Corhort 9 at Nashville Software School.
